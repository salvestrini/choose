I would thank the following peoples (that helped/inspired me):

	For their lkc changes.

* Flex & Bison authors (all of them of course ;-))

* Roman Zippel
	For his lkc (linux kernel conf)

* Joe Orton
	For his configure.ac/VERSION trick (as seen on his sitecopy) that 
	we have adopted.

* David J. MacKenzie and Paul Eggbert
        For their 'ifnames' script that inspired the 'scanconditional.pl'
	script.

* David J. MacKenzie and Akim Demaille
	For autoconf.

* Roland McGrath
	For autoheader.

* Peter Miller
	For the "Recursive Make considered harmuful" document
